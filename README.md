# ILI9488 STM32 Library

A lightweight, versatile STM32 library for driving the ILI9488 TFT LCD controller via the 8080 parallel interface. This library supports software bit-banged GPIO mode for embedded GUIs and graphics applications.

## Features

- **Display Initialization**: Configure ILI9488 orientation and color mode.
- **Hardware/Software Interface**: Use STM32 GPIO bit-bang for command/data transfers.
- **Drawing Primitives**: Pixel, line, rectangle(empty/filled), circle(empty/filled).

## Prerequisites

- STM32 microcontroller with sufficient GPIO pins.
- STM32Cube HAL drivers installed in your project.
- 18 GPIO lines for D0â€“D17 (data bus) plus control pins: CS, DCX, WR, RESET.
- Power supply and backlight control per ILI9488 datasheet.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository into your project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SnoopyNomad/ILI9488_8080_STM32_Library.git
   ```

2. Copy `ili9488.c` and `ili9488.h` into your source and include folders.

3. Configure your pin definitions in `main.h`.

## Configuration

The library is configured with the following default settings:
- Display orientation: Portrait
- Color mode: 18-bit per pixel

## Usage

To use the ILI9488 8080 STM32 Library, follow these steps:

1. **Include the Library**: Add the library header to your project.
   ```c
   #include "ili9488.h"
   ```

2. **Initialize the Display**: Initialize the display with the desired rotation using the `ILI9488_Rotation_t` enum.
   ```c
   ILI9488_Init(ILI9488_ROTATION_PORTRAIT); // or ILI9488_ROTATION_LANDSCAPE, etc.
   ```

3. **Use Drawing Primitives**: Utilize the provided drawing functions to render graphics on the display.
   ```c
   ILI9488_DrawPixel(10, 10, ILI9488_RED);
   ILI9488_FillRect(50, 50, 100, 100, ILI9488_BLUE);
   ```
